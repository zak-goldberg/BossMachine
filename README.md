# Boss Machine Project
My solution to the Codecademy Boss Machine project. This repo only includes the files I touched, not the code provided by Codecademy.

## Project Overview
[From Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/journeys/back-end-engineer/paths/becj-22-back-end-development/tracks/becp-22-build-a-back-end-with-express-js/modules/wdcp-22-boss-machine-0c8ce2d6-418b-487f-857f-49771b21894a/informationals/bapi-p4-boss-machine):
> In this project, you will create an entire API to serve information to a Boss Machine, a unique management application for today’s most accomplished (evil) entrepreneurs. You will create routes to manage your ‘minions’, your brilliant ‘million dollar ideas’, and to handle all the annoying meetings that keep getting added to your busy schedule.

## Learning Goals:
- Practice using **Node.JS**
- Practice creating routers and writing routes in **Express.JS**
- Practice writing **factory functions**:
  - This wasn't in the spec but the callback functions for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes were the same across the /api/meetings, /api/minions, and /api/ideas routes, so I thought it would be a good oppourtunity to practice this.
- Practice using git: branching, PRs, merging, etc.

## Roadblocks:
Some tests in the test file provided by CodeAcademy required some troubleshooting and updating the test script: more details [here](https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/boss-machine-post-api-meetings-test-failures-fix/840420).
